## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is an open-source project for educational purposes, no support is granted. However, we are
glad to hear feedback from any vulnerabilities or bugs in order to sharpen my coding skills.

To report any vulnerability or bug :rotating_light:, just open an [issue](https://github.com/fcesc-code/blog-back/issues) or a pull request.
